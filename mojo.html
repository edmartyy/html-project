        <h1>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Mojo Sauce: add all ingredients to a blender and purée until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, vinegar or<br>
                 honey as needed. The sauce should be loose but not thin and runny. Reserve ½ cup of the sauce and set aside. </li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a shallow baking dish. Pour the remaining sauce all over the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Cover with plastic<br>
                 wrap and set on the refrigerator for at least one hour, up to overnight. </li>  
            <li>Mojo Crema: In a small bowl, mix reserved ½ cup of mojo sauce with the sour cream and season with salt and lime juice to taste. </li>  
            <li>Chicken Thighs: Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and transfer to a sheet tray, wiping<br>
                 off as much excess marinade as you can. Let sit out at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Place chicken in the oven to bake<br>
                for 18-22 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and reaches 165˚F (74˚C). Let the chicken breast rest for about 5<br>
                 minutes before transferring to a cutting board and chopping into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Plantains: Pour about ½-inch of oil into a large, high-walled skillet and set over medium high. Once oil is hot, place 1 slice of<br>
                plantain in the oil. If it bubbles rapidly then the oil is ready. If not, remove the plantain and continue to let the oil heat up and try again.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, carefully place half the plantains in the hot oil and fry for a 1-2 minutes. Stir often as plantains release a lot<br>
                 of starch and might stick to the bottom. </li>  
            <li>Once golden, reduce heat to medium-low and carefully flip the plantains over and cook until the underside is golden brown.<br>
                 Transfer to a paper towel lined plate and let cool, seasoning with a pinch of salt. Repeat with the remaining plantains. </li>
            <li>Black Beans: Pour out most of the oil from the large skillet and return to medium-low heat. Add the chopped onions to the pan and<br> cook for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add beans and
                 their liquid to the pan, season with salt and increase heat to<br> medium. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Cover to keep warm while you make the spinach</li>
            <li>Spinach: While the beans are cooking, pour a tablespoon of oil into a second large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook<br>
                 about 1 minute, until fragrant. Add a few handfuls of spinach, stirring to coat with garlic and olive oil, and continue to fold in more<br>
                  spinach as it cooks down. Sprinkle with salt and stir frequently, about 2 to 3 minutes, until spinach is wilted. Taste and season with more salt if needed.</li>
            <li>To assemble, reheat the quinoa in a microwave and divide among bowls. Top each bowl with spinach, a large spoonful of black beans,<br>
                 a few plantains, and chicken. Drizzle mojo crema all over and sprinkle with cilantro leaves and pickled red onions.</li>
