    <h1>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425˚F.</li>
            <li>Prepare chicken thighs, seasoning skin-side generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large fry pan over medium-high heat, drizzle<br>
                 with olive oil and sear thighs, skin side down until caramelized, about 3-5 minutes. Dust chicken thighs with flour and generously<br>
                  season with salt, pepper, chili flakes and lemon zest. Flip thighs over and “fry” flour into rendered chicken fat for 2-3 minutes,<br>
                   remove chicken thighs and set aside while preparing gravy.</li>
            <li>For the gravy - Add bacon to pan, cooking until crisp and scraping up caramelized bits. Add onions and garlic to the pan, cooking<br>
                 until just tender and fragrant, about a minute. Slice 1 lemon into wedges and scatter around the pan along with fresh herbs, cook<br>
                 for another minute. Deglaze with cider and simmer until reduced by half. Stir in hot chicken stock and bring to a simmer. </li> 
            <li>Return chicken thighs to the pan, skin side up, nestling into the gravy. Zest remaining lemon over chicken and season with salt,<br>
                 pepper, and chili flakes. Pop into the oven to roast until crispy, about 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Serve straight out of the<br>
                  pan, garnishing with sliced lemon and fresh herbs.  </li>           
        </ol>
